Boys On Tour is a passion project I brought to life for my friends, the aim was to create a webpage where we can catalog desired accommodations, activities, and landmarks around New Zealand for future personal use. The target audience for this website is Unisex Young Adults aiming to find awesome places to have a vacation or road trip. This project was notable as it was the first time I used large amounts of JavaScript Object data before discovering json files. The project also uses MapBox API to mark the noted locations at their exact points in the country map.
## Technologies Used
- MapBox API is used to create a map and real-life location data for each entry.
- Animate On Scroll is used to create a fade-in effect when scrolling down the page, making the load times seamless and appearing as if the entries are appearing out of thin air and not popping in.
- Bootstrap Icons was used to implement icons for accessibility and recognition in terms of nav bars, buttons, and other icons.

## My Role
This was a solo project, I was in charge of the data creation, Mapbox coordinate gathering, HTML code, CSS styling, and JavaScript custom functionality as well as researching and deciding on what technologies to implement in this design. 
## Key Takeaways
I learned how to manage large amounts of data within a javascript object, place elements on the map within Mapbox, and solve large errors without any external help. I went the extra mile with this project compared to previous projects and stepped out of my comfort zone in terms of styling, data management and API use.
